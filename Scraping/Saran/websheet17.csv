ENGLISH OAK TREES INOCULATED W/ BIANCHETTO TRUFFLES,//territorialseed.com/cdn/shop/products/XF179_450x.jpg?v=1597273099,"Truffles top the list of gourmet delicacies, and these elusive subterranean fungi are now within reach for the home gardener thanks to centuries of effort to domesticate them. Truffles live exclusively in the soil around the roots of a suitable host tree. In this case, we have the truffle mycorrhizae established on the roots of a common English oak tree. Suitable for growing in zones 6-9, the truffles may take 5-7 years to successfully establish themselves, but the resulting annual winter harvests can last for decades. Note: Bianchetto truffles require a soil pH between 6.0-8.3. If your soil is more acidic, we recommend preparing your planting area with lime to adjust the pH well in advance of receiving your trees. 


The Bianchetto truffle is a highly prized Italian species. Its name indicates the whitish coloration in contrast to blackish truffles. Inside, the flesh is brown with white marbling, and the strong aroma is described as earthy, garlicy and cheesy. The hazelnut to golf ball-sized truffles lend themselves to a vast array of recipes.



Inoculated, 1 year old Truffle Tree seedlings start shipping in March until sold out or in early December. Order early for best availability. Available only within the contiguous US."
WASABI DARUMA,//territorialseed.com/cdn/shop/products/XV600_450x.jpg?v=1597273153,"A pungent delight seldom available to the home gardener. Even at sushi establishments and specialty grocers, 'wasabi' pastes most often derive their spicy kick from its relatives, horseradish and mustard, and lack the nuanced flavor of true wasabi: an intense, aromatic heat that quickly subsides, giving way to a smooth, sweet finish that lingers. Though chefs use any and all parts of the plant, it is prized for its root, or rhizome, which is grated and served as a ubiquitous condiment for sushi and noodle dishes in its native Japan. Wasabi has now found its way into a broader range of culinary applications, lending zing to traditional sauces, dressings, rubs, cocktails, even ice cream! Roots command up to $100 per pound here in the states, but a few specialty growers and new research from the Pacific Northwest Extension have shown promise for stateside gardens. Our hardy, disease-resistant ‘Daruma’ selection is propagated from disease-free tissue cultures. Attractive plants have heart-shaped to round foliage and will provide harvests of delicious, high quality, thick green roots and multiple plant divisions after 2 years.


Wasabi bare root plants are ready to ship now and are available only within the contiguous US. Naturally resilient to transplant stress, we ship wasabi plant starts bare root with the stems and leaves trimmed away so the plants arrive healthy. We have found that the plants travel better when shipped bare root rather than in pots because the leaf stems of wasabi can be broken during shipping or pull the plant over on its side uprooting it. They arrive ready to plant!"

Yaupon is a type of holly, a broadleaf evergreen, that is native to the southeastern US. Indigenous tribes valued the plant for its stimulating quality, but the plant fell into obscurity after colonists introduced tea (Camellia sinensis). More recently, Yaupon is enjoying a resurgence of interest. Leaf/stem preparation is simple, and the resulting tea has a mild, earthy flavor profile and can be compared to green or black tea minus the tannins (depending on the processing of the Yaupon leaf/stem). Yaupon’s high anti-oxidant content is an added bonus. The plants are handsome, textural shrubs with dense foliage and minimal fertility requirements. Established plants are drought tolerant, and they tolerate pruning well.
