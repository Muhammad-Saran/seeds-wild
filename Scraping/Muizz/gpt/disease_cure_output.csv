Disease,Identification,Solution,Additional Tips
Bird Eye Black Spot (Black Rot),"Bird Eye Black Spot, also known as Black Rot, is a bacterial disease caused by *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *campestris*. Symptoms include dark, round to irregular-shaped lesions on the leaves, often with a yellow halo. The lesions may coalesce, causing extensive tissue death, leading to early leaf drop. Infected plants may also exhibit black streaks on the vascular tissue of the stem. The disease progresses rapidly in warm, wet conditions, and in severe cases, it can cause wilting and death of the entire plant. A characteristic feature is the presence of a ‘bird-eye’ pattern, where the lesion center is darker than the surrounding tissue, resembling a bird’s eye.","To manage Bird Eye Black Spot, implement a combination of cultural and chemical control practices: 1) Use resistant varieties if available. 2) Practice crop rotation, avoiding brassica family crops in affected fields. 3) Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. 4) Avoid overhead irrigation and ensure proper field drainage to reduce the spread of the bacteria. 5) Apply copper-based bactericides or other approved bactericides at the first sign of symptoms, and reapply at intervals during the growing season. 6) Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around plants.","1) Keep the field free of weeds, as they may serve as alternate hosts for the pathogen. 2) Sanitize tools and equipment regularly to prevent mechanical transmission. 3) Use drip irrigation to minimize water splashing, which can spread the bacteria. 4) Monitor weather forecasts for periods of high humidity or rain, as these conditions favor disease development. 5) Implement good field hygiene by removing all infected plant material promptly. 6) Infected plants should be removed early to prevent the spread to healthy plants."

"Blight (Early, Late)","Blight refers to two distinct diseases: Early Blight and Late Blight. Early Blight is caused by the fungus *Alternaria solani* and typically affects older leaves first. Symptoms include dark, concentric, circular lesions with a yellow halo, usually on lower leaves. Late Blight, caused by *Phytophthora infestans*, affects both leaves and fruit and is more destructive. Early lesions are irregular and water-soaked, turning brown or black, with a distinct downy mold growth on the underside of leaves under high humidity. In both types, severe infection can cause rapid defoliation, stunted growth, and reduced yield.","To manage Blight, implement the following control measures: 1) Use resistant varieties if available. 2) Practice crop rotation, especially with non-solanaceous crops, to break the disease cycle. 3) Remove and destroy infected plant material promptly. 4) Avoid overhead irrigation to prevent splashing of spores. 5) Apply fungicides (such as copper-based or chlorothalonil) regularly, starting early in the growing season, particularly in conditions conducive to the disease. 6) For Late Blight, ensure applications of systemic fungicides that target *Phytophthora* are used, and apply them after rain events or when high humidity is expected.","1) Plant crops early to reduce the time plants are exposed to high humidity and rain. 2) Maintain good air circulation around plants by spacing them properly. 3) Sanitize equipment and tools regularly to prevent disease spread. 4) Mulch around plants to prevent soil splash and reduce disease spread. 5) Monitor plants regularly for early signs of infection, especially after rain or during wet weather. 6) If Late Blight is detected, remove infected plants immediately and avoid working in the field during wet conditions to minimize further spread."
